**Abstract**

This thesis deals with an optimization of neural network hyperparameters for EEG signal processing using evolutionary algorithms. In this work, a genetic algorithm was proposed that is suitable for hyperparameters optimization as well as neural architecture search. These methods were compared to a benchmark model designed by an engineer with expertise in iEEG processing. Data used in this work are classified into four categories and come from St. Anne's University Hospital (SAUH) and Mayo Clinic (MAYO) and were recorded on drug-resistant epileptic patients undergoing pre-surgical examination. The results of the neural architecture search method were comparable with the benchmark model. The hyperparameter optimization improved the F1 score over the original, empirically designed, model from 0.9076 to 0.9673 for the SAUH data and 0.9222 to 0.9400 for the Mayo Clinic data. The increased scores were mainly due to the increased accuracy of the classification of pathological events and noise, which may have further positive implications in applications of this model in seizure and noise detectors.

**Data**

[Data](https://springernature.figshare.com/collections/Multicenter_intracranial_EEG_dataset_for_classification_of_graphoelements_and_artifactual_signals/4681208) used in this work are publicly available.

**Repository Structure**

*GA Hyperparameters*

This folder contains source files written in Python with implemented genetic algorithm that was used for hyperparameter tuning. The hyperparameter tuning was done on a CNN-GRU architecture originaly introduced by [(Nejedly et. al, 2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-47854-6). This thesis focuses on tuning of data preprocessing parameters as well as hyperparameter of the neural network. The results are stored in json file with hyperparameters and the evaluated scores.

*GA Architecture*

This folder contains source files written in Python with the implemented genetic algorithm used for neural architecture search (NAS) and the implementation of the NAS.
